# Python Rice Roller
A python script to throw coloured dice.
When running this script two white and four coloured dice will be thrown each time this is requested.
Any coloured dice can be taken out of the game when that colour is closed by a player.
When the second coloured die is removed the game is automatically ended and the user is prompted to restart the game.
The dice can also be thrown by hitting the < space > key.
The application can be quit by either closing the window or hitting the < Enter > or 'q' keys.
Restarting is possible by hitting < Return >.

# To Do
* Add "Game ended" or "Restart" button to capture the "three failures" game-over condition
* Show each possibility of dice totals (white and colours)
* Create a scorecard
* Allow player(s) to enter a game
* Deploy as web based application for online play
